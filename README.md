# Cybersecurity: Malware Image Classification with CNN
This project focuses on the classification of malware using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify different types of malware based on their images. The project utilizes the malimg dataset, which consists of grayscale images representing malware samples. The CNN model is trained on these images and evaluated using various performance metrics.

Our project aims for a simple and effective solution for detecting and organizing malware through the use of image processing techniques. By recognizing that many types of malware share similar visual characteristics, we represent malware binaries as grayscale images. The similarity in layout and texture within families of malware is the basis for our categorization method, which relies on common image features to group similar types of malware together.


# 1. Introduction: 
Traditional methods for analyzing malware include extracting the binary signatures that serve as their fingerprint from the malware. Every year, there are exponentially more new signatures published due to the rapid spread of malware (Symantec recorded 2,895,802 new signatures in 2009 as opposed to 169,323 in 2008).

Malware attacks have been on the rise, and traditional methods of analyzing malware samples are inefficient for large datasets. Visual analysis of malware images can reveal patterns and characteristics that are not apparent from the binary code alone. Deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, have shown promise in image recognition tasks and can be applied to malware image classification. This project addresses the need for an automated and scalable solution to classify malware samples based on visual characteristics.

Overall, our image processing method provides a powerful tool for detecting and categorizing malware. By leveraging the visual similarities between different types of malware, we are able to quickly and accurately classify new instances of malware, helping organizations stay ahead of the constantly evolving threat landscape.

# Motivation: 
In this project, we aim to develop a system for visualizing and automatically classifying malware images using CNNs.
Problem Statement: The threat of malware attacks has been increasing over the years, and the ability to accurately identify and classify malware samples is crucial for developing effective countermeasures. However, manual analysis of malware samples can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, and is often not scalable for large datasets. Our project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network model to perform a Multiclass classification of Malwares from the Malimg Dataset.
